I wanted to make simple static page just to give links to my socials where I don't have to pay extra to use custom domain.

Cloudflare offers something called Cloudflare Pages, which will be more than enough to host my static page in definitely safer manner than whatever I'd come up as embedded web server that is hosted on some VPS or as a container in my small proxmox homelab.

So... I'm using simple cloudflare solution for static webpages and that's all, I can drop the mic and just go... or just write more stuff that you're prolly reading... if even!

But yeah, enjoy I guess ;D

Hit me up if you'd like to talk about something (even car's extended warranty!)

And ofc, stay hydrated!
